# Class Building Order for Object-Oriented Project

## 1. Base and Core Classes:
- **Start with foundational and core classes**, essential for the system.
- **Product Class:** Build this first, as it's foundational for other classes.

## 2. Extended and Specialized Classes:
- **Develop classes that extend or specialize the base classes**, typically through inheritance.
- **SpecialProduct Class:** Extends the Product class, to be developed right after Product.

## 3. Auxiliary Classes:
- **Build classes that support core functionalities** but are not directly the core business logic.
- **CartItem Class:** Related to Product, important for the shopping process.

## 4. Collection and Management Classes:
- **Manage collections of objects** from other classes, often involving complex data structures.
- **Inventory Class:** Manages a collection of Product objects.
- **Cart Class:** Manages CartItem collection, a key component of the shopping system.

## 5. User Interaction and High-Level Management Classes:
- **Handle user input and high-level system logic**.
- **User Class:** Manages user information, including login and authentication.
- **Store Class:** The top layer, coordinating the entire system.

## 6. Main Program and Integration Testing:
- **Write the main program** (e.g., main.cpp) to ensure cohesive functioning.
- **main.cpp:** Implements startup logic and initial integration testing.

By following this structured approach, you can gradually build and integrate your project's components, ensuring a smooth and manageable development process.
