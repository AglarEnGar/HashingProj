Certainly, here's a simplified outline for an object-oriented shopping system in English, incorporating inheritance, HashMap, and List structures, while also including sorting and searching functionalities where appropriate.

### Simplified Object-Oriented Shopping System Outline

**Product Class (Base Class)**
- **Attributes:**
    - `int productId`
    - `String name`
    - `double price`
- **Methods:**
    - Constructors, getters, and setters

**SpecialProduct Class (Inherits from Product)**
- **Attributes:**
    - `String specialFeature` - A special attribute, like limited edition
- **Methods:**
    - Constructors, getters, and setters
    - Inherits methods from Product

**Inventory Class (Uses HashMap)**
- **Attributes:**
    - `HashMap<Integer, Product> products` - Stores products, with productId as key
- **Methods:**
    - `addProduct(Product product)`
    - `removeProduct(int productId)`
    - `Product getProduct(int productId)`
    - `List<Product> searchProducts(String query)` - Searches for products with names or descriptions containing the query string
    - `void sortProducts()` - Sorts the product list by price or name

**CartItem Class**
- **Attributes:**
    - `Product product`
    - `int quantity`
- **Methods:**
    - Constructors, getters, and setters
    - `double getTotalPrice()` - Calculates the total price of the item

**Cart Class (Uses ArrayList)**
- **Attributes:**
    - `ArrayList<CartItem> items` - Stores CartItem objects
- **Methods:**
    - `void addItem(CartItem item)`
    - `void removeItem(int productId)`
    - `double calculateTotal()` - Calculates the total price of the cart
    - `void sortCartItems()` - Sorts cart items by product name or total price

**User Class (Uses HashMap)**
- **Attributes:**
    - `int userId`
    - `String username`
    - `String passwordHash`
    - `Cart cart` - Each user has their own cart
- **Methods:**
    - Constructors, getters, and setters
    - `void login(String password)`

**Store Class**
- **Attributes:**
    - `Inventory inventory`
    - `HashMap<Integer, User> users`
- **Methods:**
    - `registerUser(User user)`
    - `User getUser(int userId)`
    - `void checkout(User user)`

### Data Structure and Algorithm Implementation

- **HashMap:** Used for storing `User` and `Product` objects, allowing quick access and management by unique identifiers.
- **ArrayList:** Used in the `Cart` class, as it may frequently involve adding and removing products, where ArrayList offers better performance.
- **Sorting (Sort):** Java's built-in methods like `Collections.sort` can be used to sort products in `Inventory` or cart items in `Cart`.
- **Searching (Search):** In `Inventory`, a simple search function can iterate through the products in the HashMap, finding those whose names or descriptions match a search keyword.

### Application of Sorting and Searching

- **Sorting Products:** You might want to allow sorting products in the `Inventory` class by price or name. This can be achieved by converting the HashMap values into a list and then applying the `Collections.sort` method.
- **Searching for Products:** When users want to find specific products, you can provide a search method in the `Inventory` class that iterates through all products in the HashMap to locate those with names or descriptions that match the search keyword.

This design focuses on simplicity and efficiency, offering an example of inheritance, and considers appropriate data structures and algorithms. This framework should provide a solid starting point, which can be further expanded and customized according to specific requirements.
